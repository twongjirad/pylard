# pylard: python Liquid Argon (Event) Display

Goal is to provide a easily customizable MicroBooNE event display for both the TPC and PMT data.

The idea is to provide basic displays which the user can draw on top of.

## Dependencies

Being lazy, so have a few that serves merely for convenience:

* ROOT
* pyqtgraph
* numpy
* root_numpy
* pandas
* lz
* collada

## Installation

* install ROOT
* install dependencies
* install pylard by running
```
python setup.py install
```
* Third, hope I didn't ruin your python distribution. To be safe, I recommend using virtualenv.
